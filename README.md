# French Learning Arcade

French Learning Arcade is a simple webapp I developed for use in classrooms by elementary school core French teachers or to be used with special needs students as part of modified educational planning.

All wordlists are pre-determined, and there are no places on the website which accept user-entered content so without the use of developer features, the page cannot be altered by students..

As French Learning Arcade is a simple webpage, it can be run locally if your security policies require it. The full code is available for download from this repo, and can be adapted to suit your needs.
